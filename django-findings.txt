multiple databases: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5e_8FgKZig

1. order.objects.select_related('customer').all() -> select_related works on foreignkey('customer') only and creates a inner join in single query.
2. order.objects.prefetch_related('product').all() -> prefetch_related works on manytomany relationship and creates multiple queries and join will be at python side
	--> IN(ids) will be passed so this might be slow sometimes

3. F()-> used to find the value of column & Q() -> used to make queries in better way(by default we have only and relation in query, by using Q() we ca aslo create OR(|) relation)
4. manytomanyfield creates a third table with primary keys from both the tables

5. request.session.modified = True (in case to sequences we have to pass true so that inner values will update)
6. sessions:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sl7tSwgD0Yk
